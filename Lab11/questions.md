# QUESTIONS FOR LAB 11

## Question 1
### How do you sort your data by month?

I would sort the "mo" column by numbers, smallest first.

### How would you do this differently if you were instead trying to see all of your entries in chronological order?

I would sort the "date" column created in the last lab by date, earliest first.
Alternatively, the entries could be sorted by year, then month, then day.

## Question 2
### What is the major benefit of reconciliation? What did reconciliation do?

Reconciliation ensures all the data in the original dataset can be matched to the current dataset, and missing values could be restored.
When I completed the reconciliation, each instance of "ammospermophilus harrisii" was then linked to its webpage on the Encyclopedia of Life.
